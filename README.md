# Views Photo Grid

Drupal port of Views Photo Grid module

## About this module

This module adds a responsive photo grid display style to Views. The photo grid style arranges photos such that the height in each row is consistent, and the photos always fill up all the available width.

The photo grid adopts the arranging algorithm of jQuery Sortable Photos. Try a demo here:
